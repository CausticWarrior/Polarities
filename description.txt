Things I should do:
  Replace using AIType to control platform falling with CanFallThroughPlatforms
  Move more boss drops to being craftable
    Bat slimes should be an alt source for gigabat's material
  Disable mod in MP
  Make bestiary entries for (most) normal enemies face left
  Ensure non-buff critters can be hit by enemies
  Give worms and other drawcode-intensive enemies custom bestiary portraits
  Make salt, limestone, and fractal torches work with the torch god's favor
  Make salt suffocate the player
  Salt fishing outposts, limestone fortresses?
  Trapped versions of chests
  I should make weapons generally not go through walls as much
  Make warhammers able to hit multiple enemies per swing
  Fractal and nilmanifold menu styles (unlockable? it should notify you they're unlocked if that's the case (also change the transition screen to be based on nil geometry because it's cool))
    Possibly other unlockable menu styles obtained from beating things
  Nonconsumable boss summons (including making torch god's favor summon torch god if already used and conditions are valid)
    For the less conventional summons: Gemfly/lacewing statues?
  Make stylist? and mechanic? like ghostwriter and dryad not, give happiness dialogue, fix princess' happiness dialogue for ghostwriter
  Polarities-related emotes for NPCs to use:
    Boss emotes: Used after the defeat of their respective boss
      Additionally, sun pixie/esophage emotes should show up during their respective events
    Ghostwriter emote
    Fractal dimension emote: If the player is in the fractal dimension, probably mostly used by the regular NPC
    Blood moon and eclipse emotes should be more common in between the defeats of their respective proto-bosses and bosses
    Cichlid emote in rain
    Uncommon snek emote
  Ghostwriter should use the gravestone emote and mechanic emote, and boss emotes (when available) more often
  Furniture smart interaction
  Make the right click effects of autoswing warhammers also autoswing
  Make stellated/great stellated slimes spawn (at all? more frequently?) during meteor showers
  Boss titles maybe? (Would be a config option able to be turned off)
  Maybe make prismatic lacewings spawn after sun pixie instead of plant?
  Get rid of isolated blocks in the fractal dimension (possibly add fractal floating islands to compensate)

Planned FTW changes:
  Long cloudfish
  Giant rift denizen? Maybe w/ less attack delay? Possibly inflicts more fractalization?
  Wanderer?
  Sentinel w/ smaller arena
  Total eclipxie (eye is bigger)?
  Hemorrphage?
  Closer polarities? (Polarities but both do both types of attacks?)

Consistency concerns for special seeds:
  Drunk world:
    Salt and limestone swap generation styles (done!)
    Lava ocean generates in the middle of the underworld (this actually probably makes it easier to deal with than vanilla), convective spawns and mantellar gen also occur here
    Fractus are much more common and can grow larger
    We don't need to add an extra biome chest because it already exists
  Not the bees:
    Salt and limestone are replaced with honey above lava layer and crispy honey below lava layer (done!)
    Fractal dimension is painted yellow
  For the worthy:
    Consider increasing projectile damage (make this a config option) (also probaly fix journey mode ftw damage/health (make the health fix a config option?))
    Salt and limestone caves are more common
    Stellar remotes must generate in locked gold cloud chests instead of skyware chests
    Lava lake generation must have ash block lava pocket speckling
    Sentinel caves are probably smaller
    You probably acquire fractalization more quickly
  Celebrationmk10:
    Ghostwriter spawns immediately on world start
    Fractal dimension is probably painted with rainbow fractals
    Fractus are more common
    Most bosses are smaller than normal
  The Constant:
    Fractus will hurt you
  Fractal Seed:
    You start with regulator instead of guide
    Ghostwriter spawns in this seed even though it's the fractal dimension
    Fractal altar and twisted mirror/recall potions shouldn't take you to a subworld

Possible BG objects
  Generic background objects: Falling star constructs (possibly more common during meteor showers (this could maybe apply to actual dormant constructs and both stellated slimes)), cloudfish
  Rapture BG objects: Glowing sunbeams (even at night)
  Pestilence BG objects: Red and purple spores floating up from the terrain (more red in corruption, more purple in crimson)
  Hell BG objects: Flocks of lavafowl (killing polarities should remove these)
    Lava ocean BG should remove most of the lava BG stuff
  Killing the polarities should remove migratory bird BG objects
  Fractal background objects: Various fractal creatures? Rifts? I need to make the dimension feel more alive so it should probably feel like there's as much depth in random systems that don't do that much as there is in the overworld
